<strong>Close to the customer:</strong> If your customers succeed, so do you. Let them drive strategy.
<br><strong>Actions add value:</strong> Be experimental, work in stages, manage risks, but get on with it.
<br><strong>Performance culture:</strong> Identify the scorecards and metrics that determine performance.
<br><strong>Ethical vision:</strong> The Golden Rule for all customers, competitors, stakeholders and employers.
<br><strong>Think differently:</strong> You can't do any better if you are the same as everyone else.
<br><strong>Seek insight:</strong> Insight reduces risk, and drives performance and sales.
<br><strong>Work intensely:</strong> Because intensity separates the best from the average.
<br><strong>Enjoy your work</strong>
