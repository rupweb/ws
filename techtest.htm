<b>The dreaded technical test</b>
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day, another dollar... and another interview. As usual your prospective employer glows with admiration for your achievements past, and is already thinking of how you can best contribute to his team, but there is the small matter of the technical test before you can join the ranks.
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical test... People are looking for accuracy, speed and efficiency. The only trouble is that there is no specific syllabus, and information technology is quite a broad subject! So there goes another test in an area where I know precious little, something like VB forms programming. Well I have seen it done a couple of times before, and VB is not exactly rocket science, is it, but even though I completed the test with every piece of code at rights (and I reckon some better ideas for real time monitoring of the working program), it took me too long to be offered the contract. Too slow.
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me of another test I took for a leading investment bank. The trading floor was magnificent enough, but I was asked to take a technical test on UNIX user groups. The IT knowledge I have comes from years of applications development experience, not so much UNIX user support. So in a closed book, timed, technical test I could answer about 3 questions out of 10. Another area of computer science where fluency appears the only answer to who gets the appointment. Don't know.
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the answer is to get the questions before the "exam", or get your friend who spends every hour of every day coding away to take it for you. Tell the prospect that you are not going to turn up unless you get some clear idea of the syllabus. On one technical test I did for a leading investment bank the job spec was for a C++ support analyst, but the questions in the test turned out to be C/UNIX and SQL. I had no idea what part of C++ would be questioned or where to go for the answers. What is the point of wasting everybody's time with technical tests where the student may not see what is expected of him?
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how many technical tests I have flunked... alot. After a computer science degree and years of software experience I sometimes wonder what it is I actually know about!
