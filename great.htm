<p><b>Some rules for strategy</b>

</center>

<p>



<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My business research distills many strategy reports down to the following:

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Close to the customer: If your customers succeed, so do you. Let them drive strategy.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Actions add value: Be experimental, work in stages, manage risks, but get on with it. Too much planning creates analysis paralysis.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Create a culture: If you don't it will create itself. I like the balanced scorecard, and "the three rules" see below. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Ethical vision: Try and follow the Golden Rule in dealings with all customers, competitors, stakeholders and employers. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Think differently: But you can't do any better if everyone is the same as everyone else. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Seek insight: Insight makes your company low risk, and drives performance and sales. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Work intensely: Because intensity separates the best from the average. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Enjoy your work: it gives you a long term competitive advantage over someone who doesn't.



<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raynor and Ahmed show in their book "the three rules" 

<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Better before cheaper: in other words, compete on differentiators other than price. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Revenue before cost: that is, prioritize increasing revenue over reducing costs. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. There are no other rules: so change anything you must to follow Rules 1 and 2.
