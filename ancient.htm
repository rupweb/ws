Thinking of <u>classical business strategies</u>, the book of Ecclesiastes deals heavily with work and business, and has many great quotes on "the business that is done". For example:

<p align=justify>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I applied my mind to know wisdom, and see the business that is done on earth... I saw that wisdom exceeds folly as light exceeds darkness. The wise man has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness; and yet I perceived that one fate comes to all of them. I said to myself, "What befalls the fool will befall me also, why then have I been so very wise?" And I said to myself that this also is vanity. For of the wise man as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise man dies just like the fool!"

<p align=justify>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing out of context you could try and typify this quote as cynical, or stoic, or a philosophy saying that business on earth suffers from mortality, and that is empty. Among several scenarios the writer concludes many times that to eat, drink and find enjoyment in all work is the only certain reward. The tenor sounds like David Hume's much later philosophy of mitigated scepticism, in which absolutely everything is theoretically uncertain and can be doubted, but practically we have to actually live and to work, which isn't really to do with theories of everything. Living, and working, is therefore a matter of passion over reason. 

<p align=justify>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think a clear message for business strategy is not to over theorise. Do your business analysis but take your best judgment for action in between the wisdom and the foolishness. Theory may only lead to analysis paralysis. Meanwhile your competition is taking action...
