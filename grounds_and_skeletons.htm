<tr><td valign="top">(1) The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52/practice-direction-52c-appeals-to-the-court-of-appeal#5.1">grounds of appeal</a> must identify as precisely as possible the respects in which the judgment of the court below is (a) wrong, or (b) unjust because of a serious prodecural or other irregularity, as required by <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52#52.11">CPR rule 52.11(3)</a>.

<p>(2) The reasons why the decision under appeal is wrong or unjust must not be included in the grounds of appeal and must be confined to the skeleton argument.

</td><td>

<p>(1) The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52/pd_part52#V">Skeleton argument</a> is to assist the court by setting out as concisely as practicable the arguments upon which a party intends to rely.

<p>(2) A skeleton argument must:

<ul>

<li>be concise

<li>define and confine the areas of controversy

<li>be set out in numbered paragraphs

<li>be cross-referenced to any relevant document in the bundle

<li>be self-contained and not incorporate by reference material from previous skeleton arguments

<li>not include extensive quotations from documents or authorities

</ul>

<p>(3) Documents to be relied apon must be identified

<p>(4) Where it is necessary to refer to an authority, the skeleton argument must (a) state the proposition of law the authority demonstrates; and (b) identify the parts of the authority that support the proposition. If more than one authority is cited in support of a given proposition, the skeleton argument must briefly state why.</td></tr>
