<thead><tr><th>Misperception</th><th>When actually</th></tr></thead>

<tr><td width="250"><b>Harmony helps</b></td><td width="*">Quite the opposite, research shows. Conflict, when well managed and focused on a team's objectives, can generate more creative solutions than one sees in conflict-free groups. So long as it is about the work itself, disagreements can be good for a team.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>It's good to mix it up</b></td><td>The longer team members stay together as an intact group, the better they do.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Bigger is better</b></td><td>Excessive size is one of the most common - and also one of the worst - impediments to effective collaboration.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Face-to-face interaction is over</b></td><td>Teams working remotely are at a considerable disadvantage. There really are benefits to sizing up your teammates face-to-face.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>It all depends on the leader</b></td><td>The hands-on activities of group leaders do make a difference. But the most powerful thing a leader can do to foster effective collaboration is to create conditions that help members competently manage <i>themselves</i>. </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Teamwork is magical</b></td><td>It takes careful thought and no small about amount of preparation to stack the deck for success. The best leaders provide a clear statement of just what the team is to accomplish, and they make sure that the team has all the resources and supports it will need to succeed.</td></tr>
