Cadle, Paul and Turner say the following Business Analysis techniques are among the most useful:

<p>

 <b>CATWOE: Customer(s), Actor(s), Transformation, Weltanschauung, Owner, Environment</b>

<br>

Often organisational problems are caused by differences of Weltanschauung between stakeholders. Unless the differences are brought out and discussed then they undermine efforts towards new processes and systems.

<p>

 <b>Business process modelling (swimlanes) </b>

<br>

Models reveal inconsistencies in a process and bring out the "as is" status quo.

<p>

 <b>Use cases </b>

<br>

Rough pictures of what a new system will look like, and what it will do.

<p>

 <b>Workshops </b>

<br>

Properly facilitated, they are fast and build consensus and support for the way forward.

<p>

 <b>Mind maps </b>

<br>

Summarise the essence of a business issue, or the essence of discussion at a meeting.

<p>

 <b>Interviewing </b>

<br>

A soft skill that may reveal issues that don't come out of a workshop.

<p>

 <b>Organisation diagram </b>

<br>

Shows the main stakeholders, key competitors and customers, before getting into the detail.

<p>

 <b>Scenario analysis </b>

<br>

Sometimes enables users to articulate requirements.

<p>

 <b>Cost benefit analysis </b>

<br>

Identify tangible and intangible cases for business analysis work.

<p>

<p>

 <b>SWOT </b>

<br>

BA work is all about exploiting strengths, overcoming weaknesses, seizing opportunities and staving off threats.

<p>

 <b>Prioritisation </b>

<br>

Nobody can do everything at once, and management is often a matter of difficult choices between alternatives. Try MoSCoW.
