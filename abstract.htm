<b>Abstract</b>

<p align=justify>

A project to design a software program which gathers data each day on the five leading components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from the New York Stock Exchange. The program prepares the data for quantitative analysis using statistics software to perform regression testing of the relationships between money flows into the five highest volume shares and money flows into the Dow Average the following day.

<p align=justify>

The data gathering and formatting was carried out using Microsoft Visual Studio C#, SQL Server 2000 database and a webpage. The statistics were computed by the Vista statistics package.

<p align=justify>

The key findings were a negatively correlated relationship between the actual dollar amount of funds moving into or out of the leading five shares today, and the dollar change in the level of funds moving into or out of the Dow Average tomorrow compared to today.
